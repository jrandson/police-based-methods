# police-based-methods

In this repo, I explore the implementations of two different policy-based methods.

Part #1
In this part, you'll explore an implementation of a cross-entropy method. To begin, open the Workspace in the next concept, and open CEM.ipynb (in the cross-entropy folder).

Part #2
In this part, I explore an implementation of hill-climbing with adaptive noise scaling. To begin, open the Workspace in the next concept, and open Hill_Climbing.ipynb (in the hill-climbing folder).
